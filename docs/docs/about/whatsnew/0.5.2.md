# What's New in NSClient++ 0.5.2

**Highlights:**

* Brand new REST API
* Much improved documentation
* ZIP-Modules
* Op5Client

In addition to the above we have the usual slew of bug fixes and minor enhancements.
One important change is that the code base have been re-factored in many places meaning the code will be easier to access for new developers.
But more importantly this will allow for better unit testing in the future.

## REST API

The new REST API is a true rest-full API which is not built around the internal protobuf API.
This means it will be much simpler to work with and will allow you to much easier integrate it into your systems.
The API also get support for uploading both scripts and modules to provide a truly remote configurable client.
But the most important feature is access control on a per method level as well as user/password authentication.
This means you can add a user which will only be allowed to run queries but not alter the configuration.
We have also swapped out the old moongose implementation for one which is multi-threaded which means it will function a lot better under high load.

## Documentation

Not only have we switched to a much easier to read template for the documentation we have added numerous pages about the
REST API, Zip modules, Python script as well as much internal updates.
In addition to this we have also reworked the reference section so it contains more useful information and less bloat.

## Zip-modules

In brief zip-modules allow you to package scripts together as zip-files for easy distribution and use.
With zip modules you can enable or disable all script in one go via the regular load/unload module concept.

## Op5Client

A brand new Client which talk to Op5 natively via their northbound (Passive REST) API.
The installer also has MSI options so you can silently install NSClient++ which automatically registers and becomes monitored from Op5.
```
msiexec /i NSClient++.msi OP5_SERVER=https://op5.com OP5_USER=monitor OP5_PASSWORD=rotinom
```
